        The includes can be specified in two ways: as a string

        the relative path to the include file and optionally a 'repo'

        missing the value of the 'file' key, it is treated the same as if
        just a string was defined, meaning the path is relative to the
        current config file. Otherwise it is interpreted relative to
        the repository path.
